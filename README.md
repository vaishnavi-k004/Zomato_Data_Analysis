## 🍽️ Zomato Data Analysis Using Python

### 📊 Project Overview
#### This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Zomato restaurant dataset to uncover insights into pricing trends, cuisine distribution, and customer behavior. The analysis focuses on transforming raw data into meaningful information through structured preprocessing and visualization.

### 🛠️ Key Techniques
#### Data cleaning, missing value analysis, outlier treatment, and feature engineering were applied to ensure data quality. Advanced methods such as categorical encoding, TF-IDF for text data, StandardScaler normalization, and PCA for dimensionality reduction were used to prepare the dataset for machine learning tasks.

### 📈 Outcome
#### The project demonstrates how data-driven analysis can support better recommendations, customer segmentation, and business decision-making for food delivery platforms.

### 💻 Tech Stack
#### Python · Pandas · NumPy · Matplotlib · Seaborn · Scikit-learn
