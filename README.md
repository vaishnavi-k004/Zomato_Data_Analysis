Zomato Data Analysis Using Python

This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Zomato restaurant dataset to analyze pricing patterns, cuisine distribution, and customer behavior. The workflow includes data cleaning, handling missing values, outlier treatment, and feature engineering to ensure high-quality analysis.

Advanced techniques such as categorical encoding, TF-IDF–based text processing, StandardScaler normalization, and PCA for dimensionality reduction were applied to prepare the data for machine learning and clustering tasks. Visualizations were used to extract actionable business insights.

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
